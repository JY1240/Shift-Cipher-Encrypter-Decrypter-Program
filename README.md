# Shift-Cipher-Encrypter-Decrypter-Program
Shift cipher is a simple encryption method. When encrypting a message, every letter in the original  message is replaced by a different letter k positions down the alphabet (modulo by 26), where k is an  integer. 

Note: 
1. Assume that the message only contains upper case letters, space characters and punctuation marks. 2. Space characters and punctuation marks remain unchanged during the encryption.
2. A shift cipher decrypter can guess the message without knowing k. If a message is long enough, the most  frequent letter will be ‘E’.

Task 1 (Design & Implementation)
Write a program to implement the shift cipher decrypter. You are advised to run your program with a message  of at least 200 words such that the alphabet distribution follows the general pattern. Do the following tasks: 
1. Select suitable data types. 
2. Count the letter frequencies of the cipher text. 
3. Find the possible values of k . 
4. By using stepwise refinement, describe the algorithms for decryption. 
5. Use a flowchart to describe the algorithms in (d).

You may want to consider some of the following key factors when designing the program: 
1. data structure
2. variable declaration and initialization
3. data collection, input and validation
4. data processing
5. program output
6. interface of the program
7. modularity
8. reusability
9. portability
10. system development cycle
11. sorting and searching algorithm
